          <p><p>His last comment on the Internet is relevant to Hacker News.. someone asked him about unemployment due to automation and the rise of technology[1]:</p><p>&quot;If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.&quot;</p><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;science&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3nyn5i&#x2F;comment&#x2F;cvsdmkv?st=JEQKSDNR&amp;sh=dd00aa5a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;science&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3nyn5i&#x2F;comment&#x2F;cvs...</a></p></p>

          <strong>PaulHoule:</strong>
          <p><p>At risk of being voted down I will say that the time in which Hawking has worked has been a &quot;dark ages&quot; for physics in my mind.  (As a physics PhD;  and I don&#x27;t blame Hawking for this,  rather the rest of the environment.)</p><p>Circa 1970 the number of physics PhD&#x27;s produced has outstripped the number of permanent jobs in physics,  sometimes by a factor of 30:1!</p><p>One result of that is that physicists have to make it through a keyhole to get established.  Another change that has happened since then has been a profound disconnect between theory and experiment.  Back in the day,  Einstein could make a prediction about light being bent by the Sun and have it be confirmed in his own lifetime.</p><p>The &quot;modern&quot; physics superstar like Hawking or Witten just doesn&#x27;t do that.  When neutron oscillations were finally detected after years,  it is almost forgotten who to give credit for for the theory because it is really just a conjecture that some matrix element isn&#x27;t zero.  Even in condensed matter there is the spectacle of seeing theoreticians dogpile on the problem of cuprate oxide superconductivity for 20 years without making any progress until an experimentalist noted stripes in the electron density.</p><p>The result of it is that you get ahead by getting the approval of much older physicists,  not by understanding the world.</p><p>As for Hawking himself,  his ideas about information loss in black holes,  the wavefunction not being unitary and all that were just plain bad ideas that held back quantum gravity by 30 years or so.</p></p>

          <p><p>Perhaps just as shocking to me as this news was the fact that he was 76! Given his accomplishments and youthful demeanor in his recent communications this totally caught me off guard. That, and the fact that he lived <i>way</i> longer that expected, given his circumstances. Objectively a triumph. In addition to his obvious, scientific exploits, hopefully the money raised in 2014 for ALS will ensure future scientists won&#x27;t have to endure such hardship.</p><p>Rest in peace.</p></p>

          <p><p>For a second I just couldn&#x27;t believe this was real. Stephen Hawking was one of those people that inspired me towards a career in science, as well as a pursuit of discovering what mysteries of the universe I could uncover within my (cosmically short) lifetime. He did this not through some major life-altering speech I heard from him (although his talks and lectures were quite interesting), or through some grand quote that I read online, but rather through the fact that he carried with him the enthusiasm that comes with looking up, seeing a vast universe looming all around us, and finding that inner spirit--that inner sense of wonder--that drives us forward in an attempt to make sense of it all. Rest in peace Stephen Hawking; you will be missed.</p></p>

          <p><p>Growing up in the middle of nowhere, Canada in the 1980s, the library didn&#x27;t have many good science books. When Hawking&#x27;s book got published, it was the only thing available like that anywhere around. Remember, this is before you could get any book in existence within one month via Amazon. There was no Amazon.</p><p>I got <i>A Brief History of Time</i> and read it, and it&#x27;s almost cliche to say so, but it changed the course of my life. It&#x27;s not the only book that affected me, but it was pivotal. George Gamow&#x27;s little book also was available, and some good Asimov stuff, but otherwise nothing really.</p><p>So I went to university in the big city (Saskatoon!) and studied physics, and they had a whole <i>library</i> of physics books! You&#x27;d think it was like heaven, but a lot of those books were crap or hard to read. Hawking showed how one can aim for a book that&#x27;s interesting-and-good and actually achieve it. A few others managed to do the same. There are probably 20 actually-good and readable physics books in the whole world, and his books are a few of them.</p></p>

          <p><p>Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator, and, if so, does he have any other effect on the universe? And who created him?</p><p>Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe what the universe is to ask the question why. On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, “The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language.” What a comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!</p><p>However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by
everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason – for then we would know the mind of God.</p><p>-- Stephen Hawking</p></p>

          <p><p>Oddly, this news struck me harder than other recent deaths of celebrity musicians that I was huge fans of.  I guess Professor Hawking always had that aura of timelessness around him, and everyone just knew he was doing important work that would change humanity&#x27;s understanding of the universe and our place in it.</p><p>It seems somehow unfair to have him taken away in the middle of all that.</p><p>EDIT: Fond memories of walking around Cambridge University two decades ago with my cousin, and she casually pointed to a building and said &quot;Oh, Stephen Hawking works in there&quot;.  Seemed so mundane to think that such important works were going on in some nondescript building that I just happened to be walking past.  I always envisaged him working on a totally different plane from the rest of us mere peons.</p></p>

I strongly believe that his perseverance through his circumstances is even more admirable than his research. It&#x27;s so easy to become bitter and jaded when a shocking event like that occurs. At the best, you make peace and live as happy a life as you can...but to stand tall and rebuke Fate, defy all odds and even banish almost certain Death for decades through sheer willpower and passion for knowledge is something else. And to hold that tiny, bright flame against an unrelenting torrent for 55 years, always curious, always following his passion...the world lost one of the greats tonight.</p></p>
